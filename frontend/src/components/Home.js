					Jules is a femme photographer and mixed media artist who’s work explores
					violence, pain and queerness. They were raised in Calgary - the land that has
					given so much to many - and now reside in Tkaronto.
					Jules is a 4th generation survivor of intimate partner violence and sexual
					assault. Much of their work navigates healing intergenerational trauma and
					harmful family values that make those in power feel entitled to control others
					emotions. Jules is often reflective of how to decolonize within her own family,
					allowing femme elders in her life to be soft rather than combative, and to find
					power in rest and love. Today, Jules works as a consent educator, facilitating
					conversations about how to create cultures of consent, set and respect
					boundaries, and support survivors. Much of her work is shaped by lived
					experience and she is greatly fulfilled by validating the experiences of other
					
					survivors and helping them to have conversations about consent in trauma-
					informed ways.
					
					Jules' artistic practice explores how the mind and the body remembers the
					past. They were raised to believe that if you are mentally strong enough to
					ignore physical pain, you will be rewarded. This, intertwined with familial
					discomfort surrounding vulnerability, leads one to ignore their body’s warning
					signs of trouble. Battling with undiagnosed pain throughout their body, and
					especially their hands, Jules’ recent work explores how to talk about pain and
					learning to navigate the world with their ever-changing needs.
